# Speed-Typing-Test
A speed typing test using Python is a program that measures a user's typing speed in WPM. It presents a text passage, starts a timer, and checks the user's input for accuracy. Once completed, it displays the user's results, including WPM, accuracy, and errors. It's a helpful tool for improving typing skills.
